# Courses

Musings in :computer: Computer Science Education :computer:

The repository is intended to gather a series of essential courses and skills into a succinct and central location.
Each course is intended to be concise, but also explain why the skill or course is necessary. The work should usually be
on the more practical / hands-on side, with a little theory of course.

This is not intended to cover the entire set of courses at a university, but be a set of courses that can get someone started on the right track.

In the end, this repo should have outlines for courses in:
 - math
 - logic
 - philosophy
 - software design
 - databases
 - networking
 - security
 - systems & infrastructure
 - data structures
 - algorithms
 - etc.
 
Feel free to contribute content. I do suspect this will end up being more than computer science as well.
 
# Development
 
- Courses are represented as a persistent [yaml file](https://github.com/jules2689/courses/blob/master/courses.yml), as are the categories at the top of the file.
- `bin/render` will render the persistent yaml file into the `doc` folder.
- `bin/server` starts a basic Python HTTP server (required for the link structure)
- `bin/testunit` runs a series of tests to make sure everything runs smoothly :ok_hand:

# General Concepts

This is a take on the MVC design pattern, but with a renderer replacing the "C" (controller).
Given this, the [yaml file](https://github.com/jules2689/courses/blob/master/courses.yml) is loaded into model objects which are then renderered into erb templates and saved into `docs/`
The entire thing is hosted on Github pages.

### Renderers
- A [website renderer](https://github.com/jules2689/courses/blob/master/lib/renderers/website.rb) renders the website as a whole, handling things like static files (assets) and directing other renderers.
- The [components renderer](https://github.com/jules2689/courses/blob/master/lib/renderers/components.rb) handles rendering individual compontents, such as a course, section, or category.
