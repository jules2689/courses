        description: |
          Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic and statement logic,
          is the branch of logic that studies ways of joining/modifying propositions, statements or sentences
          to form more complicated propositions, statements or sentences. It also looks at the logical relationships
          and properties that are derived from these methods of combination and alteration.

        description: |
          Functions, sets, and relations are the fundamental building blocks in mathematics.
          Sets are collections of defined objects.
          Relations indicate relationships between members of two sets.
          Functions are a kind of relation where there is exisrs exactly or at most
          one relationship for all elements in set A (aâˆˆA) with an element in set B.

        title: The basics of counting
        image: /assets/images/math.jpeg
        description: |
          Counting has many applications in computer science and mathematics.
          It can be used for various tasks such as counting the number of operations,
          successes and failures in experiments, and much more. While the concept seems
          simple enough, it is important to be able to know how many <i>combinations</i>
          and <i>permutations</i> there are in a given number of sets, among other important
          attributes.

          Covering the basics of graph theory, isomorphism, cycles, trees, directed graphs
          will be some topics covered here. Each of these topics represents one area of 
          math and computer science that is fundamental to the way systems work. Whether
          representing a network, a real-world problem, or a virtual one - graphs and the
          algorithms you can apply are able to accomplish a lot.
